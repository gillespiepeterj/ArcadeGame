# ArcadeGame
Single player arcade game project using a Raspberry Pi 2 and Retropie emulation software for Raspberry Pi (using emulation station emulator).

***Phase 1*** - Complete
- Raspberry Pi runs Retropie - https://retropie.org.uk/
- Hardware buttons connect to physical GPIO pins of Pi. An additional utility is required to map GPIO pins for control instead of USB used by default on Retropie. I used the Retrogame utility from Adafruit - https://learn.adafruit.com/retro-gaming-with-raspberry-pi/retropie-improving-emulator-performance?view=all
- Runs off a re-chargeable 3.7VDC, 500maH LIB. The only external cable needed to play is an HDMI output to a display (TV, pc, etc...).
- I also used a Powerboost 1000 circuit that allows load sharing while charging battery with a 5V power supply plugged into the wall.

- I followed the control box pdf dimensions as a rough guide. I eyed all cutouts and holes using a dremel and drill. I will be 3D printing next box.

***Phase 2***
- Make 2 players compatible.
- Create model to 3D print control box.
